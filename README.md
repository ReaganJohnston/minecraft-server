# Reagan's Minecraft Server
Install guide and file repository for the necessary mods and programs needed to join the server. The server uses minimalistic plugins and mods so your performance won't be impacted no matter which OS you are using (talking about you Mac peasants)

## What you will need:
1. A Minecraft Account
2. The Minecraft launcher installed
3. Java 8 installed on your computer (can be accessed through here): https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
5. Maybe a brain

## Windows Install
Download the files attached to this repository, ```voicechat-forge-1.19-2.2.45``` and ```forge-1.19-41.0.45-installer```. The ```voicechat-forge``` is a mod that is added to your game profile when you install the ```forge-1.19``` file.

### Forge 1.19 install
Literally download the ```forge-1.19-41.0.45-installer``` and **_double-click it_**. 

Select **_Install Client_** and press "ok". See the image below

### Adding the voicechat mod to your minecraft version
1. Download the file ```voicechat-forge-1.19-2.2.45``` and keep it easily accessible.
2. On the windows search bar type in ```%appdata%```. Hit enter to search.
3. Open up the ```.minecraft``` folder
4. Drag and drop / Copy and paste the ```voicechat-forge-1.19-2.2.45``` file into the **_mods_** folder.
   - If you don't have the mods folder create one inside the ```.minecraft``` directory. Make sure to call it ```mods```, it's case sensititive!!
   - If you have mods already inside this folder,  that aren't supported by 1.19 I would suggest removing them (e.g. the old voicechat file). 

### Final Steps
Start up the Minecraft Launcher, making sure to select the ```forge 1.19-forge-41.0.45``` as the current playable version. It should have automatically selected for you so all you need todo is press **_start_**. Happy mining!


## MacOS Install
Make sure you have installed Java 8 JRE, as this is essential for the ```forge``` install. You can get the java installer here at this link https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Similar to the Windows Install, download the files attached to this repository, ```voicechat-forge-1.19-2.2.45``` and ```forge-1.19-41.0.45-installer```. The ```voicechat-forge``` is a mod that is added to your game profile when you install the ```forge-1.19``` file.

### Forge 1.19 install

1. **_RIGHT CLICK_** on the downloaded ```forge-1.19-41.0.45-installer.jar```
2. Open with ```Java Launcher (default)```

Select **_Install Client_** and press "ok". See the image below. Note the version listed on the image below is outdated, DO NOT WORRY if your forge version is different on your computer than on the image.
